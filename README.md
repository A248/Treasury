# 💼 Welcome to Treasury!

## 📜 What is Treasury?

Treasury is a upcoming resource containing a modern API to facilitate virtual money
transactions on Minecraft servers between Economy providers (aka. Economy plugins) and plugins
that wish to use them (e.g. JobsReborn, ShopGUIPlus).

Like Vault, Treasury is installed as a plugin on a server. The plugin only offers an information
command and update checker. Treasury is used by economy provider plugins through Bukkit's
Service Manager.

## ❓ Why Treasury?

The following is my personal opinion ([lokka30](https://github.com/lokka30)).

I have a drive to make things better for server owners and plugin developers. I've found that the
existing economy APIs are unsuitable for modern economy plugins, at least to my own criteria.

Although I can deal with using [Vault](https://github.com/MilkBowl/Vault), it has not advanced its aging code which restricts the
capabilities of Economy providers through its limitations. For example, its API does not directly
support non-player transactions (you have to use their deprecated methods which breaks economy
provider plugins) and has no multi currency support.

I think [Reserve](https://github.com/TheNewEconomy/Reserve) tried to get at this, but I think it is too bloated, and I really prefer the
simplistic roots of Vault. Whilst Reserve is harder to use, Treasury is almost as simple as Vault
to use in plugins. Reserve has been out for a few years and has seen very limited success especially
relative to Vault. This is likely because plugin developers do not see it fit for adoption.

Vault and Reserve are the only key APIs currently out there that offer anything substantial and have
sufficient usage.
